Surrealist marketing has always been pretty hit or miss for me. Some brands go overboard in their attempts to seem quirky and offbeat. I've seen many companies hop on this bandwagon, even when it clashes with their brand identity. The result is jarring. Nobody wants to see their favorite fast-food chain posting outdated memes and roasting customers on social media. It comes off as cringeworthy and painfully unfunny.

Don't get me wrong, I can be pretty cringeworthy and unfunny myself! I could give the Wendy's Twitter account a run for their money. I understand that consistently making an audience laugh is difficult, especially when that goal is balanced with trying to sell a product and maintain a certain brand image.

Humor is subjective. Online trends move fast, and online audiences can be unforgiving. Creating a brand voice that incorporates both clever humor and authentic messaging is no easy feat. It's a delicate balance to strike.

Yet although this is an incredibly challenging task that takes years for many marketers to master, some navigate it with remarkable finesse, seamlessly integrating the surreal and the absurd into their marketing strategies.

I've noticed one brand that appears to do this almost effortlessly.

Surreal is, for lack of a better word, surreal. It is a brand of healthy no-sugar cereal that aims to mimic the taste of your favorite childhood breakfast snacks. That's why they call it Surreal, according to their [website](https://eatsurreal.co.uk/pages/about). “Because it shouldn't work, but it does, brilliantly.” This is also how I'd describe their marketing.

Surreal operates entirely out of the UK and—as far as I can tell—doesn't have international shipping. Their marketing has no business being so brilliant that it captures the attention of random folks across the globe. Yet here we are. Even though I may never get the chance to try Surreal cereal, their marketing is so effective that I'm writing paragraphs about it anyways.

Surprisingly, Surreal's marketing manages to be both surreal and _real_ at the same time. Their social media posts are charming and fun. Their billboards are creative and interesting to look at. But they never try to distract you from the fact that they're advertising cereal. They're pretty straightforward and transparent about it.

That's a major part of what gives Surreal its charisma. The marketing never feels as though it's trying to be something it's not.

Instead of a constant churn of half-baked humor, Surreal produces campaigns that are imaginative and entertaining, yet still remarkably down to earth. They never take themselves too seriously, yet you can tell that they put thought into everything they do (even when they try to make it seem like they don't).

The photo above is one of many examples from Surreal's January 2024 ad campaign, an initiative with the tagline "Can't be bothered this month? Neither can we." This message is more than simply amusing—it's relatable. Their marketing approach resonates with consumers, creating a connection that feels both clever and genuine.

In a sea of uninspired marketing gimmicks, Surreal stands out in all the right ways. Surreal's ability to capture the attention of consumers while staying true to their brand values is a testament to their marketing prowess.
